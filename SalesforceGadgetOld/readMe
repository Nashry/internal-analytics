The gadgets in this folder can be deployed by the following steps:

1)Take a snapshot of the Opportunity_Trend__c object in salesforce and store in the database with table name 'OpportunityTrend'. 
Use the same names as in salesforce for the columns.
The db URL needs to be modified according to user's db.
    eg:-var db = new Database("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/sf", "root", "root");
    
2)Place the gadgets in wso2das-home/repository/deployment/server/jaggeryapps/portal/store/carbon.super/gadget
3)Change the url of the jquery post method to the user's jaggery server url
eg:-$.post( "http://10.100.4.35:9763/hostedForGadgets/DataProducts.jag", 
                            {"entYear":input[0]},function( data ) {
                                DrawGraph(data);
                        });
4)Create a folder called 'hostedForGadgets' and place the jaggery files in jaggery-0.9.0-SNAPSHOT/apps/hostedForGadgets
5)Run the DAS and jaggery server's and use the gadgets
